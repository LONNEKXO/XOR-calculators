This repository contains XOR calculators. As evident from their names, they specify the operations they perform. 
Additionally, within the folders, you'll find .jar and .exe files, indicating that these calculators function as applications. 
They compute the XOR of two values and determine the bitwise difference between them. 
Enjoy using them!
